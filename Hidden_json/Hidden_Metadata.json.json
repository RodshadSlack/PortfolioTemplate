Battle Royales, Street Races, Fashion Shows, Gambling, Building, Taming… anything your heart desires. In Eden.3 there are no rules only one question; “How much are you willing to pay?” The answer is always $GENS. Genesis Pixels is the native currency of Eden.3. It can be generated passively by OGDs, won through bets, Genesis Games, or even stolen in Red Zones. There will only be 3777 Genesis OGDs. Each of these Genesis pieces will act as a mint pass into phase 2 of OGdegeneration.",
